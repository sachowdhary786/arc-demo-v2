My main focus for this task was to ensure that the UI was built out properly, I decided to go down the route of using a calendar library, as I didn't feel the need to reinvent the wheel, to save time overall. 
I tried to match the design of the existing website, but without full design documentation, I could only go by eye. The colour scheme is slightly different to the main website, but the secondary colour of the logo is present in the UI. 
I would have paid more attention to the colour scheme, had I had more time, I would give more attention to the design principles of the company. 

With regards to the technical implementation of the Calendar, I tried to go down the route of using axios api library with Next.JS as this is a library that I have never fully used before but wanted to attempt to see if I was able to use it within the small time frame given. 
Whilst I was able to receive the data from the API (after much coaxing and aggressive tendencies) I ran out of time in order to be able to store and display the data against the UI, as I would have had to read the documentation for both Axios and FullCalendar in order to understand how to get them to work together. 
I wouldn't change my approach in how I went about this task, as it presented a great learning opportunity in order to expand my knowledge
